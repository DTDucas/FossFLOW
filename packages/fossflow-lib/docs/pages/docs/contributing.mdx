### Branching Strategy:

Branches are named using the following convention:

- `feature/` for new feature implementations
- `fix/` for broken code / build / bug fixes
- `chore/` non-breaking & non-fixing code changes such as linting, formatting, etc.

### Commit / PR Strategy:

- Commits are to be squashed prior to merge
- PRs are to target a singular issue in order to keep the commit history clean and easy to follow

### Deploying to NPM

CI is sensitive to any tag pushed to `main` branch. It will build and deploy the app to NPM.
To deploy:

1. Bump the version using `npm version patch` or similar
2. `git push && git push --tags`
